edit startup -- turtles check for a startup script when they turn on
print("Name: " .. os.getComputerLabel())
print("ID: " .. os.getComputerID())
print("Fuel: " .. turtle.getFuelLevel())

-- anything you put in startup will run when the turtle boots. 

edit CheckFuel -- puts you in the editor in file CheckFuel
print "Checking fuel..."
if turtle.getFuelLevel() < 200 then
	turtle.refuel(1)
	print "Refuelling!"
else
	print "Good on fuel"

tunnel 10 -- will tunnel 10 spaces (or 9, I forget) in a 3x2 block

excavate 2 -- excavates a 2x2 block downwards until inventory full or out of fuel

-- when inventory is full, turtle returns to start point and ejects all its inventory. If you have obsidian pipe (or any
-- transport pipe, I guess) that leads to a chest, it will suck it into that chest

-- can set up a Charge Station (Misc Peripherals mod) to recharge them (REMEMBER TO USE LOW VOLTAGE ONLY!)

-- melee turtle can be used as a mob grinder

-- use this to set the name of your turtle, which allows it to keep its charge/programs when broken (among other things)
label set <labelname>

-- you can dye turtles! as of ComputerCraft 1.63
